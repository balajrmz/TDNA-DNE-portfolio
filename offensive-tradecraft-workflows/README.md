# Offensive Tradecraft Workflows

Operator-style workflows for target characterization, access vector discovery, and exploitation validation.

## Contents (Planned)
- Recon and scoping workflows
- Service enumeration decision trees
- Validation playbooks (lab-based)

## Why it matters for TDNA/DNE
Consistent workflows enable rapid, defensible analysis of targets and more reliable validation of theoretical access paths.
