# Identity Attack Paths (AD / Hybrid)

This section focuses on identity-centric targeting and attack-path analysis in Active Directory and hybrid environments.

## Contents (Planned)
- Kerberos abuse and delegation paths
- LDAP/SMB enumeration and trust relationship mapping
- Privilege escalation chains and misconfiguration-driven access paths

## Why it matters for TDNA/DNE
Identity is often the shortest path to access. These notes and workflows map trust relationships and feasible escalation routes.
