# Application Access Vectors

Analysis of how applications expose access paths through authentication, authorization, and service integration.

## Contents (Planned)
- Authentication and session weaknesses
- API surface mapping and trust boundaries
- Chaining application flaws into broader access paths

## Why it matters for TDNA/DNE
Applications often bridge identities and networks. Understanding access vectors helps identify feasible paths to initial access and lateral movement.
