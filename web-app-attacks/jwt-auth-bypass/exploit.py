JWT Auth Bypass / Privilege Escalation PoC

This script is a template for demonstrating insecure JWT validation.
Once the vulnerable lab is running, the script will:

1. Authenticate as a normal user
2. Capture their JWT
3. Modify the payload to escalate privileges (role -> admin)
4. Re-sign the JWT using a weak or known secret
5. Access protected admin routes with the forged token

For educational use only.
