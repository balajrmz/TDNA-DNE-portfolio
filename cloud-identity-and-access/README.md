# Cloud Identity & Access (IAM)

Target-centric analysis of cloud identity boundaries and IAM access paths.

## Contents (Planned)
- Azure IAM and Entra ID misconfigurations
- AWS IAM policy analysis and privilege paths
- Hybrid identity attack paths (on-prem AD ↔ cloud identity)

## Why it matters for TDNA/DNE
Cloud identity misconfigurations frequently enable access without exploits—through policy, roles, trust relationships, and over-permissioning.
