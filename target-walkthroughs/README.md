## 🖥️ Target Walkthroughs (Sanitized)

This section contains **sanitized, methodology-focused walkthroughs** derived from publicly available training environments. These are not step-by-step exploit guides; they are **analyst-style breakdowns** emphasizing *decision-making, attack-path reasoning, and transferable patterns* relevant to TDNA and DNE work.

All walkthroughs are OPSEC-safe and focus on *how to think*, not just *what to type*.

## What You’ll Find Here

Each walkthrough emphasizes:

- Reconnaissance → enumeration → access → privilege escalation chains  
- Identification of viable attack paths and dead ends  
- Decision points and reasoning behind tool and technique selection  
- Patterns that generalize across environments (not box-specific trivia)  

These walkthroughs are designed to demonstrate **analytical tradecraft**, not memorization.

## Available Target Walkthroughs

Located under:
```
target-walkthroughs/
```

Current walkthroughs include:

- **Bashed** — Web enumeration leading to command execution and privilege escalation  
- **Beep** — Service discovery, credential reuse, and multi-vector exploitation  
- **Blue** — SMB exploitation and post-exploitation privilege escalation  
- **Devel** — Web shell access and Windows privilege escalation  
- **Lame** — Multi-service enumeration and legacy service exploitation  
- **SolidState** — Credential harvesting, service abuse, and escalation chains  

Each directory contains a dedicated README with sanitized notes and methodology.

## How to Use These Walkthroughs

These walkthroughs are best read as:

- Case studies in access-path reasoning  
- Examples of how enumeration drives exploitation choices  
- Training material for TDNA/DNE methodology development  

They are intentionally written to support **transferable learning**, not one-off solutions.

## OPSEC Note

- All targets are lab-based or publicly documented training systems  
- No production environments are referenced  
- No sensitive indicators, credentials, or customer details are included
