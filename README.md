# 🛡️ Target Digital Network Analysis & Digital Network Exploitation Portfolio
**By Jan Zabala — TDNA | DNE | AI-Assisted Target Analytics | Identity & Network Attack Paths**

Welcome to my **Target Digital Network Analysis (TDNA)** and **Digital Network Exploitation (DNE)** portfolio.

This repository showcases work focused on analyzing digital networks as **adversary targets** — identifying access vectors, attack paths, and exploitation opportunities across **identity, applications, and infrastructure**.

All content is developed in **lab, synthetic, or public environments** and is designed for clarity, reproducibility, and operational realism.

## 🔍 Areas of Focus

- Target Digital Network Analysis (TDNA)  
- Digital Network Exploitation (DNE)  
- Identity-centric attack path analysis (Active Directory & Cloud IAM)  
- AI / ML–assisted target analytics  
- Automation and exploitation validation  
- OSCP-style offensive tradecraft workflows  

---

## 🧭 How I Approach TDNA & DNE

My work follows a **target-centric methodology**, rather than tool-driven exploitation:

1. **Target Characterization**  
   Network topology, identity boundaries, exposed services, and trust relationships.

2. **Access Vector Identification**  
   Authentication paths, misconfigurations, protocol weaknesses, and application logic flaws.

3. **Attack Path Analysis**  
   Chaining access across identities, services, and systems to assess feasibility and impact.

4. **Exploitation Validation (Lab / Synthetic)**  
   Hands-on validation of theoretical access paths using controlled environments.

5. **Reporting & Translation**  
   Clear articulation of findings, assumptions, and operational relevance.
