# 🛡️ Offensive Security Engineering Portfolio

**By Jan Zabala — AI‑Driven Offensive Security | Red Team Engineering | Cloud Identity Threats**

Welcome to my Offensive Security Engineering portfolio. This repository showcases the work I do at the intersection of:

* **Red Team Operations**
* **Active Directory & Cloud Identity Attacks**
* **AI/ML‑Driven Offensive Security**
* **Automation, Tooling, and Attack Simulation**
* **OSCP‑style methodologies**

Everything here reflects **real-world offensive engineering**, built as tools, pipelines, and frameworks designed for reliability, reproducibility, and clarity.
