# 🛡️ Target Digital Network Analysis & Digital Network Exploitation Portfolio
**By Jan Zabala — TDNA | DNE | AI-Assisted Target Analytics | Identity & Network Attack Paths**

## ⭐ Flagship Project: ShadowHound

**ShadowHound** is an identity attack-path analysis engine for **Active Directory**, designed to support **Target Digital Network Analysis (TDNA)** and **Digital Network Exploitation (DNE)** missions.

It treats identity infrastructure as a **target surface**, enabling analysts to reason about privilege escalation paths, lateral movement, and exploitation feasibility using graph analysis and ML-assisted risk scoring.

📂 **Start here:** `ai-driven-security-projects/shadowhound/`  
➡️ This is the best single project to review for understanding my approach to adversary-centric network analysis.

Welcome to my **Target Digital Network Analysis (TDNA)** and **Digital Network Exploitation (DNE)** portfolio.

This repository showcases work focused on analyzing digital networks as **adversary targets** — identifying access vectors, attack paths, and exploitation opportunities across **identity, applications, and infrastructure**.

All content is developed in **lab, synthetic, or public environments** and is designed for clarity, reproducibility, and operational realism.

## 🔍 Areas of Focus

- Target Digital Network Analysis (TDNA)
- Digital Network Exploitation (DNE)
- Identity-centric attack path analysis (Active Directory & Cloud IAM)
- AI / ML–assisted target analytics
- Automation and exploitation validation
- OSCP-style offensive tradecraft workflows

## 🧭 How I Approach TDNA & DNE

My work follows a **target-centric methodology**, rather than tool-driven exploitation:

1. **Target Characterization**  
   Network topology, identity boundaries, exposed services, and trust relationships.

2. **Access Vector Identification**  
   Authentication paths, misconfigurations, protocol weaknesses, and application logic flaws.

3. **Attack Path Analysis**  
   Chaining access across identities, services, and systems to assess feasibility and impact.

4. **Exploitation Validation (Lab / Synthetic)**  
   Hands-on validation of theoretical access paths using controlled environments.

5. **Reporting & Translation**  
   Clear articulation of findings, assumptions, and operational relevance.

## 🖥️ Target Walkthroughs (Sanitized)

This section contains **sanitized, methodology-focused walkthroughs** derived from publicly available training environments. These are not step-by-step exploit guides; they are **analyst-style breakdowns** emphasizing decision-making, attack-path reasoning, and transferable patterns relevant to TDNA and DNE work.

All walkthroughs are OPSEC-safe and focus on *how to think*, not just *what to type*.

### Available Target Walkthroughs

Located under:
```
target-walkthroughs/
```

Current walkthroughs include:

- **Bashed** — Web enumeration leading to command execution and privilege escalation
- **Beep** — Service discovery, credential reuse, and multi-vector exploitation
- **Blue** — SMB exploitation and post-exploitation privilege escalation
- **Devel** — Web shell access and Windows privilege escalation
- **Lame** — Multi-service enumeration and legacy service exploitation
- **SolidState** — Credential harvesting, service abuse, and escalation chains

Each directory contains a dedicated README with sanitized notes and methodology.
