# 🛡️ Offensive Security Engineering Portfolio

**By Jan Zabala — AI‑Driven Offensive Security | Red Team Engineering | Cloud Identity Threats**

Welcome to my Offensive Security Engineering portfolio. This repository showcases the work I do at the intersection of:

* **Red Team Operations**
* **Active Directory & Cloud Identity Attacks**
* **AI/ML‑Driven Offensive Security**
* **Automation, Tooling, and Attack Simulation**
* **OSCP‑style methodologies**

Everything here reflects **real-world offensive engineering**, built as tools, pipelines, and frameworks designed for reliability, reproducibility, and clarity.

* Laying the groundwork for automated risk scoring and analysis APIs

**Tech:** Python, AWS/Azure IAM Concepts, JSON Policies

---

## 4. **PacketVision — Network Capture Exploration Lab**

📁 `labs/packetvision/`
📌 *Completed*

A lab centered on offensive use-cases for packet inspection, where I:

* Parse and inspect network captures
* Explore visibility gaps and attacker tradecraft
* Prototype ideas that may later feed into AI-assisted recon or detection bypass tooling

**Tech:** Python, PCAP/Traffic Analysis

---

## 5. **ZeroTrace — Offensive Stealth & Telemetry Lab**

📁 `labs/zerotrace/`
📌 *Completed*

An experimental space for:

* Studying logging and telemetry gaps
* Exploring stealth techniques and detection resistance
* Prototyping concepts that inform how I design and test offensive tooling

**Tech:** Python, Logging/Telemetry Concepts, Offensive R&D
